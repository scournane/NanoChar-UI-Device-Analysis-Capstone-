TEAM NANO
Nanodevice collection and measurement software

This is a capstone project for Dinh Loc Duong, Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Maine, in partial fulfillment of the Computer Science BS degree for the University of Maine. This project aims to build a user-interface software for real-time collection, storage, and analysis of resistance measurements from nanodevices under varying temperatures (3-300 K) and magnetic fields (up to 2.5 Tesla). The system will interface with experimental hardware, providing a user-friendly platform to manage data and control various measurements. The ultimate goal is to simplify complex measurements for students and researchers, and to offer compatibility with existing hardware systems like the Keithley instruments. This project is meant to be implemented on Windows.

The software will:
Interface with hardware (Keithley 2450 and Keithley 6221/2182A).
Collect and manage experimental data in real-time.
Provide a user-friendly interface for multiple types of nanodevice measurements, including gate-tunable and 4-probe resistance measurements.
Offer 2D/3D visualizations and color maps of the collected data.
Store and analyze large datasets in 3 or 4 dimension

The software uses Custom TKinter by Tom Schimansky
